# LearningPython

In March 2019 I started trying to learn python to automate a garden using a Raspberry Pi. I realized I did not know anything about python so I started working through a book called 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. Some of the work I completed working through 'Learn Python the Hard Way' can be found in this Repository. After a while I started working on mini projects using youtube tutorials in order to expose myself to some Python libraries like Numpy, Tkinter, Pandas, and PyGame. 

I tried to pick tutorials that involved areas I was interested in exploring, like Neural Networks, Graphical User Interfaces, Login & Register Systems, and analyzing financial information in a CSV. All of the YouTube Tutorial projects I completed can be found in this repository.

Now,I've learned to read through documentation to put together python scripts. The most recent one being a script to analyze a CSV from my Chase Bank account. 

I have a lot more to learn, and as a result I welcome suggestions + constructive criticism. I would also be interested in exploring & learning from a collaborative project.
